# thtmlx
Typed HTML [X â†—](https://x.com) is a simple Python HTML generation tool with safe escaping and type safety. `thtmlx` also supports typed CSS.

**Try it out**:

```python
# create a shortcut
import thtmlx as x

# create a div
ele = x.div(
    x.p("Welcome to typed html!"),
    x.a("hot pics", href="https://discord.com/jobs", target="_blank"),
    x.p("click on it lil bro"),
    # apply *typed* css styles
    style=(
        x.css()
        .display("flex")
        .flex_direction("row")
        .align_items("center")
        .justify_content("space-between")
        .color("white")
        .background_color("red")
    ),
)

print(ele)
```

Output (raw):

```html
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;align-items: center;justify-content: space-between;color: white;background-color: red;"><p>Welcome to typed html!</p>
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;jobs" target="_blank">hot pics</a>
<p>click on it lil bro</p></div>
```

Note that `thtmlx` does not format generated contents by default to increase the overall speed.
